Introduction
WiFi hacking is a critical aspect of network security, enabling professionals to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in wireless networks. This guide covers a range of techniques and tools that are essential for understanding and mitigating these risks. Whether you're targeting WEP, WPA, or WPA2 networks, this repository will provide you with the knowledge and practical skills to effectively conduct WiFi hacking.

Tools
Aircrack-ng
Aircrack-ng is a powerful suite of tools for assessing WiFi network security. It includes utilities for capturing packets, injecting packets, and cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 keys. This section provides an overview of its installation, basic usage, and advanced features.

Wifite
Wifite is an automated wireless auditing tool that simplifies the process of WiFi hacking by automating the use of other tools like airodump-ng and aireplay-ng. It offers a user-friendly interface and is a popular choice for both beginners and experienced hackers.

Reaver
Reaver is a brute-force attack tool that targets WPS (WiFi Protected Setup) PINs to recover WPA/WPA2 passphrases. This tool is particularly effective against routers that support WPS, making it a valuable addition to any WiFi hacking arsenal.

Fern Wifi Cracker
Fern Wifi Cracker is a graphical tool that simplifies the process of cracking and recovering WEP, WPA, and WPS keys. It provides a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of wireless network adapters.

netsniff-ng
netsniff-ng is a versatile network toolkit that includes utilities for network packet sniffing, monitoring, and analysis. It is particularly useful for capturing and analyzing network traffic in WiFi networks.

Techniques
WPS Brute Force Attack
This technique involves using Reaver to perform a brute-force attack on a WiFi network's WPS PIN. By exploiting vulnerabilities in the WPS protocol, attackers can recover the WPA/WPA2 passphrase, gaining access to the network.

WPA Handshake Capture
Capturing a WPA handshake is a crucial step in cracking WPA/WPA2 encrypted networks. This section details the process of capturing a four-way handshake using tools like airodump-ng and aircrack-ng, followed by cracking the captured handshake.

Examples and Use Cases
This section provides real-world scenarios and examples of how these tools and techniques can be applied. Whether you're conducting a penetration test or exploring network security, these examples offer practical insights into WiFi hacking.
